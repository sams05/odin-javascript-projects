## Giphy Assignment

My work for TOP's assignment on [working with APIs](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-working-with-apis#assignment). Refactored to use [async/await](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-async-and-await#practice).

### Topics covered:
- Serializing and parsing JSON
- Callback hell and promises
- The event loop
- Using the Fetch API to access and extract data from an API.
- async/await
    - `async` makes the function into an asynchronous function, i.e. a [promisory (promise factory)](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/async%20%26%20performance/ch3.md#inertia), which uses its return value as the promise's fulfillment value.
    - `await` extracts the fulfillment value from a promise.
